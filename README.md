### Project Description
A desktop notification system that's more distracting than helpful. Get ready for a barrage of hilarious, and frankly, useless notifications , which having  funny Malayalam dialogues that will make you question your life choices.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world of constant productivity and focus, we've identified a critical lack of meaningless distractions. Who needs important alerts when you can have a screaming goat on your screen?
